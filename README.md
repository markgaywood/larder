# Larder
Bit of simple java fun with my chef son.

### Requirement
1. build a `Larder`. This is either a box, cupboard or many rooms of varying temperature that store items of `food`.
1. do a stock take itemising:
   1. what stock you have;
   1. what you are out of.
1. make a recipe(s) using the items you expect to be in the `Larder`. 
1. design a `menu` and make sure you have enough stock to cater for 20 guests.
